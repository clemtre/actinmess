<p>My undergraduate thesis, which questions our capacity for action in urban space and demonstrates the importance of the unexpected and the appropriation of individuals in the environment. Brief submitted in February 2022 and summarizes the ways of doing things and the positioning of the designer I aspire to. Here, images of the article structured and the outcome published. The final object of the article consists of various elements contained in an engraved metal box. The goal is to make the reader active through the manipulation of different media.</p>

<p>The first installation that materializes the first step towards the project: a stele to generate consultation and gather citizen expertise. This stele uses tools that I used to use, turning in order to attract the eye and create interaction. This first step helped me establish a dialogue with the community of Place des Fêtes (Paris 19) to co-design an urban development project. The consultation resulted in the proposal of a large-scale construction game for children. This game was presented in the form of a workshop that was held on 27-28 May in the square and which invited the young public of the Place des Fêtes to appropriate a building system. This proposal comes from an analysis of the needs of the place that demonstrated the usefulness of the ephemeral game library. It was expressed the need for recreational activity for the young public of the place des fêtes and the fact that the building of Capla was not at all equipped and became a game library in spite of it. This intervention aims to present a spontaneous and free way of appropriation of urban space</p>
