<p>This research investigates the material properties of hemp fibres, and in particular, their applications in the paper industry. Hemp has been used for paper production since ancient times, evidence worldwide can be traced back to 900 bc or to medieval times. However, the progressive industrialisation of paper produc - tion combined with the prohibition of Cannabis (and conse - quently hemp crops) in the 1930s caused the disuse of hemp in favour of wood pulp. Currently, hemp is still applied for different uses in small niche markets, for instance, in the one of cigarette paper manufacture. With “In search of porosity” the aim is to reevaluate the use of hemp in the paper industry through the lens of porosity, defined by Richard Sennet in the essay «Open City» in which he defines the concept of Social Porosity, Physical Porosity and Sensorial one.
 <em>The author argues Social porosity is the ability of social groups, or communities, to interact one with another in the same environment. The Physical one belongs to the actual pores of a surface. This allows elementary fluidity, the phy - sical transmission of factors across the surface and within the object. Sensorial porosity is, rather, the capability of inhabitants to perceive certain phenomena over limitations and boundaries. The importance of defining porosity,, lies in understanding the idea of limit</em></p>
