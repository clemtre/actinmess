<p>Stimulated by a concern for catastrophic ecological urgency and a frustration with urban
space as a study environment, this writing is rooted in one term: ecovillages. Expressing a concrete
and pragmatic will, seeking a material solution, this paper is focused on rurality, techniques and
tools. Looking for a place to land and grow an alternative out of it, the label “ecovillages” came. This work looks at ecovillages in France and Netherlands, their relationship to tools and ecology and the position of architecture within this realm.
