<p>This series is linked by exploring the creative process of translation from parametric digital computing to artisanal handcraft. The idea is to challenge metal casting with 3D printing and see how this recent and trendy technique can work and help metal casting. The parametric program is based on the shortest path between two points and this very mathematical property makes the casting efficient. It is also a search for efficiency through material economy and stress resistance with these particular shapes. This material research has then been applied to candleholders or knifes. Finally the same procedural design was applied during a collaboration with the artist Orestis Tilemachou in a serie of ceramic vases with transparent resin attachements.</p>
