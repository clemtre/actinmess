<p>Dutch Design Week 2023: Cringe or Cool? Curation and scenography Dogtooth™ is an emerging Design Studio based in Eindhoven(cofounded with Tony Tao Li). For DDW 2023, we have curated a group exhibition hosted by the art gallery DeFabriek comprised of ten original works all stemming from the central theme of ‘Cringe’ in a contemporary context. «One might think that ‘Cringe’ is a phenomenon without explanation: a kind of revulsion reflex in face of a public demonstration of clumsiness or ignorance. The term has become the formula dedicated to designate a feeling that social networks have helped to make more common: ‘an indirect discomfort’» - Robin James from Le cringe algorithmique, un outil de contrôle social Fascinated by the extended effect of Cringe and the role it plays in design, we propose an exercise where visitors are invited to explore Cringe in our contemporary societal panorama and its influence on norms and trends. The exhibition will feature a series of installations curated from invited peers that explore various deep-dives of Cringe-Influenced objects and networks. From fashion to music, from memes to video games, the work will challenge our judgements with Cringe at the nucleus. The experience will guide visitors through an active participatory scenography whereby you are prompted with choices to make between Cringe or Cool. The space will feature a path-based directional journey through ten works&#47;objects that display each artists’ subjective lens of Cringe.
