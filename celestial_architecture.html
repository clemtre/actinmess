<p>This project is the result of a week of workshop spent at the Boisbuchet estate under the guidance of the Spanish architecture agency ArquitecturaG. Three blocks of concrete in an open and wild field to lie down and score a point to look at the sky. These blocks essentially present the relationship of the body to space when we want to observe the stars. These blocks have thought dimensions from the human body and have three different sizes. The ambition lied in the simpliclty of the proposal and the contrast created with the wild field in which they are immersed. The three are scattered in the architectural park of Boisbuchet.</p>
