<p><em>«The disappearance of animals from urban and rural lands - capes and their cramming into factory farms has the effect of destroying both the mental image of the animal and the real link between animal and human beings. Placed on the margins of society, the slaughte - red animal no longer exists as an individual.»</em> AUBINIERE Sarah, Represent the slaughterhouse Agrarian refers to cultivated land or the cultivation of land. In Middle ages and renaissance period, the production of food was a primary inspiration for decorations and interior design. The hunt, the fields, the fishes and the farmer were represented in various narrations often romanticizing the production. Since the 60’s globalisation, the narrative of land cultivation have left the domestic spaces to be only contained in advertisment. The decorative components of today’s interior furniture is mainly an abstraction depraved of stories. What would a collection narrating the food production in 2024 look like? This is the question motivating this collection of four pieces: the chicken, the haystack, the pixel farming and the machinery are a selection of hyperobject represented in this collection. Poultry Delicassy is the first piece of this collection, it is a clo - thing rack in aluminium representing this mechanical cleaniness with a playfull and agressive twist. The chicken, hyperobject more then a sentient animal is displayed like a hunt trophy.
